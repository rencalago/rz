                  <p>This wildlife experience in the Philippines is located in Carmen, about 1-hour driving distance from Cebu City. It is a must-visit for widlife enthusiasts and nature lovers. Visitors can see and interact with various animals in their natural habitat in this 170-hectar property</p>

                  <h3>How much is the entrance fee?</h3>
                  <p>We visited the Cebu Safari adventure in June 2022 and if I'm not mistaken the entrance fee was at 900 per person. They now have different pass packages apart from the regular ticket. If you are visiting on weekend & holiday, your ticket will cost you 200 more (P1100)</p>
                  <br/>
                  <h3>How to get there from Cebu City?</h3>
                  <p>It would be much convenient to go there by private vehicle / or rented van since the place is quite far from the main highway. But you can easily take the north bound bus from the Cebu North Bus Terminal. Ask the driver to drop you off at the Carmen Plaza. Look for the signage that says Cebu Safari Adventure.</p><br/>
                  <h3>Bird Show</h3>
                  <p>After buying tickets, we hopped into their serviced bus shuttle for the bird show. We're so lucky we arrived on time. They have variety of birds from the colorful parrots to the impressive birds of prey. Guests will be entertained by these birds performing tricks and natural abilities.</p><br/>
                  <h3>How to get around?</h3>
                  <p>This is a big place and getting around would be impossible without their serviced shuttle conveniently located at every attraction. </p><br/>
                  <h3>What should be our route plan?</h3>
                  <p>I'm happy with our route plan when we get there. We started off at the bird show, then got a quick meal at a restaurant nearby. Afterwards, we visited the white lion. We didn't expect it far, but it was a scenic route on the way. Then we shuttled down to the african savannah where we walk from there, down to where the crocodiles are. All the way to giraffes's area. </p> <br/>
                  <p>We took the long trail from the giraffes' area all the way down to the birds area where we had the bird show. </p><br/>
                  <p>I think it was in the Michaels Garden where they have those kids playground. Enzo was excited but we didn't stop to play because it was quite late in the afternoon. </p><br/>
                  <p>Then there was this collection of statues of safari animals where we took photos from. It was such a wonderful art to look at. </p><br/>
                  <h3>Should we go back</h3>
                  <p>Our son was 1.5 years old at the time we visited Cebu Safari. We didn't bring the stroller because we knew it would be hard to push around on incline path, plus we need to get in and out of the shuttle, and it's gonna be so inconvinient to carry it inside the vehicle. So, there were a lot of carrying, about 80% of the time while in the park.</p><br/>
                  <p>I think it would be more fun for us to visit again when he's around 5 years old. When he can confidently walk by himself and can appreciate the wildlife adventures it offer. Overall, this is a perfect place for the whole family to explore and experience the best of wildlifes and nature. </p>
