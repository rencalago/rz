                <h2>Celebrating Valentines Day 2023 at Lalimar</h2><br/>
                <p>We had a great date night celebrating valentines day as they offer bundle prices for 2 at 799. The food was great plus we have wine on the table. We didn't stay long because our 2-year old son was already messing the table lol! There were bands serenading guests on their special dinner. We go before they even started. They have nicely prepared the platform with valentines decorations to take photos with. </p>
