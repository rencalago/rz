                <p>The Cebu Ocean Park is a must-visit attraction in the queen city of the south, cebu city. It is located in the Cebu South Road Properties at the back of SM Seaside City Cebu beside the San Pedro Calungsod Chapel.</p><br/>
                <h1>How to get to Cebu Ocean Park?</h1><br/>
                <p>From anywhere in the metro, you can take a taxi going there. Or take the MyBus to SM Seaside then exit to the mountain wing. Maybe around 3 minutes walking distance from there. </p><br/>
                <h1>What to expect</h1><br/>
                <p>You'll see what you've never seen before :-) The best place to learn about marine biodiversity. They've got names of every animals on the tank and some interesting description of them. So check those out. </p><br/>
                <h1>What not to miss?</h1><br/>
                <p>You shouldn't miss the feeding session at the big tank. There will be one in the morning and in the afternoon. This area in the park is a great spot to take a break from all the walking, maybe grab a bite while watching at those enormous fish being mouth-fed. I think this is the highlight of all the attraction here. Just sitting still and looking at those wide-mouthed sea gentles chewing their treats pleasurely.</p><br/>
                <h1>Where to take some nice photos?</h1><br/>
                <p>That's a good question to ask, and my personal favorite is at that arched glass aquarium. Yep, guessed it right :)</p><br/>
                <h1>Swim with the fish</h1><br/>
                <p>During our visit (Apr 2022), there were few people who did take the close-up encounter. It's cool to swim around and see those beautiful colorful fish up-close.</p><br/>
                <h1>Try out their Fish Spa</h1><br/>
                <p>When we visited the Manila Ocean Park in 2008, I enjoyed the painless tickling nibble of those fish. I didn't have the chance to do it here. But you should try it. It's fun and truly relaxing.</p>
