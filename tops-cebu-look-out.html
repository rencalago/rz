                  We felt lucky we're able to visit Cebu Tops a few months before it got closed to visitors. We drove up to the mountain of busay a few minutes before sunrise. When we got there we had spectacular view of the sunrise slowly picking out from behind the clouds. 
                  </p>
                  <p><br/>
                  It was a sunday early morning so when we got there, there were just a few people chilling around. It was a bit cold, and we didn't stay long.  
                </p><br/>
                <p>There's not much you can do around here except enjoying the best view of the Cebu City skyline, and the awesome buildings from afar. I think this is the best vantage point when there's some fireworks display at downtown. Although looks so tiny from here, it's a unique experience to try. You might as well need to bring binoculars. But of course if you're into photography, you can definitely capture your best shots here. Maybe long exposure shots at night with city lights backdrop interests you more? </p>

                <p>According to the news report, Cebu Tops is being closed temporarily after opening its door in 1985. They are doing some construction to improve the facilities in this popular tourist spot in Cebu City. The developer wants to make it world-class with its brand new look. Of course the view is always the highlight. </p>
              <br/ >
                <p>I can't wait to go visit Cebu Tops again when it open to the public in the future. </p>
