                    The METRO in Bais City finally open its doors starting August 15, 2025. It is the first Metro Gaisano in Negros Oriental. We've had a chance to visit Metro Bais City friday last week. During our visit, it was not as crowded as the grand opening week. 
                    <br><br>
                    To the left from the main entrance is the famous Rib Shack restaurant - full packed with diners. To the right is a hardward store. And going straight is the supermarket. While there are dozens food stalls at the side of the hallways. I've also seen Executive Optical (EO) just in front of the Rib Shack restaurant. Upstairs is a wide open space where you can shop for clothing, electronics, school supplies and others. I didn't expect it to be so cold because they have this open ceiling design but it's really comfortable to walk around.

                    <h3>The Location</h3><br>
                    The Metro is located along the main road - it is on the left side, if you are heading to the north from Dumaguete City. Just a few steps away from Jolibee. I'm not sure if they have other parking areas but the front parking is good. However, it get so busy especially during peak hours. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Grand Opening Traffic</h3><br>
                    We passed by the area during the Grand Opening, and true enough that area near the mall is crowded with cars and vehicles. Thanks to the hardworking and deligent traffic officers, we're able to pass through without too much delay. 
                    <br><br>
                    <h3>Going to Dumaguete No More</h3><br>
                    The main hub for commerce in Negros Oriental is in <a href="https://www.rencalago.com/travel-to-dumaguete-places-to-visit">Dumaguete City</a> which is over 50 kilometers from Bais City. With this new mall people wouldn't need to travel for hours to the main City just to go shopping. And around the corners in Bais City, there are already big banks and restaurants.
